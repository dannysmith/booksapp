# React Books Tutorial

### Idea

1. Build simple react app
2. Use Flexbox to lay out the book component
3. Use Grid to lay out the books
4. Get data from a [static Gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dannysmith/0e203810e2561d235fad1175487b43c3/raw/5e4bb34d44c00f2ad2a5d0d1fdcb93fc3364a0d2/books.json) route to begin
5. Deploy to Netlify
6. Switch to getting Data from Airtable base API via a Netlify lambda function.

```shell
npx create-react-app book app
yarn add normalize.css node-sass
```

Add some basic CSS and clear out old code. Rename css files to Sass See second commit.
