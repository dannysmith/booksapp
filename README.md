# Books

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## TODO

- [ ] Create a Lambda function in `./functions` that gets Books from Airtable
- [ ] Call this to get the books array
- [ ] Clean up CSS for Book
- [ ] Clean up JS for Book - extract some stuff into components?
- [ ] Add proptypes for all components
- [ ] Add CSS overlay for book images (maybe use CSS filters?)
- [ ] Add default book image and use while loading real images
- [ ] Add some subtle animations with CSS and/or SVG
- [ ] Test on multiple viewports / add tiny responsive things.
